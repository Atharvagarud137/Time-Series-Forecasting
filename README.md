# Time-Series-Forecasting using XGBoost
This repository contains a Python implementation for forecasting energy consumption using machine learning techniques and XGBoost. The goal of this project is to predict energy consumption based on historical data, which can help optimize energy usage, plan for future demand, and make informed decisions about resource allocation.

## Requirements
To use this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:
* Python 3.6 or higher
* Jupyter Notebook or any other Python environment
* Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn libraries
* XGBoost library

You can install the necessary Python packages using the following command:

**pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost**

## Results

The trained XGBoost model can be used to make accurate energy consumption forecasts based on historical data. The notebook also includes visualization techniques to evaluate the performance of the model, such as time series plots and error metrics.
